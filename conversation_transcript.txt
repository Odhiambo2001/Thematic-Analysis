Laura: So thanks for agreeing to meet with me again. I just wanted to ask a couple of follow up questions. First, tell me what you perceive to be the main benefits of instructional coaching. 

Ashley: Well, especially in my beginning years, you can kind of compare it to a baby or a toddler, those first few years of teaching are very formative, and my coaches were instrumental in helping me figure out who I was as a teacher because everyone is different, you know? They not only helped me with curriculum, standards and strategies, but with developing my identity as a teacher. 
Laura: I love that analogy. Do you believe instructional coaching has played a role in retaining teachers in the profession?
Ashley: I think it does. I don’t think it’s an all or nothing thing. Like, just an instructional coach isn’t enough to keep anyone in teaching and hopefully not impactful enough to make them leave. But they contribute to teachers feeling supported and having help that administrators just don’t have time to provide. So yes, I think they help in keeping teachers in the profession because they provide support and guidance that is so desperately needed. 
Laura: Okay. In your opinion, what could be done to enhance the effectiveness of instructional coaching?
Ashley: Perhaps having more of them? And making sure that they have expertise in the areas that they are expected to coach in? Ours do, but I know there are some that were maybe kindergarten teachers who are now working with upper grades teaches as well so there isn’t a huge level of comfort there. I think it would be good at the elementary level to make sure you have a lower grades coach and an upper grades coach. Or a reading coach and a math coach just to make sure we are getting the best out of them and that the teachers in the building feel comfortable taking suggestions from them. 
Laura: Good points…Has instructional coaching had an impact on your job satisfaction?
Ashley: I think so. It’s nice to have someone not on your team and someone who isn’t responsible for your evaluations to be able to go to for support and advice, or even just to vent. It’s a judgement free zone. 
Laura: Can you share any specific examples of how instructional coaching has influenced your teaching practice? 

Ashley: I think that has changed as I’ve spent more years in the profession because my needs as a teacher have changed. In the early years they were in my classroom more. Providing direct support, modeling, etc. But now I don’t need that as much so they have been really helpful, particularly this year with helping me learn the new curriculum and planning and providing resources because it’s a lot. So rather than me having to go through everything, they have helped with that and it is what I need now, but that could change next year. 
Laura: ok, last question. How do you believe instructional coaching impacts your professional growth and development?

Ashley: Well like I said just a minute ago, they meet me where I am. Coaching isn’t a one size fits all type of thing. So even though I wouldn’t look at myself as a new teacher anymore, they are still really helpful and I believe that I can always get better as a teacher so sometimes I tell them what I need help with and they know me so sometimes they give me suggestions to help me grow and develop. 
Laura:
Okay, so thanks for meeting with me again today. One of the reasons I wanted to meet with you again was I found it interesting that you had transitioned from an elementary school to a middle school. So I just kind of wanted to get some perspective from you on the differences in what the coaching looked like at the elementary school as opposed to what it looks like now when you're at a middle school.
Amanda Crowder:
So in elementary, I felt like there was a lot of support from the coach because that was their sole job. They didn't have any other position, they weren't a teacher, and then also in a leadership role of that sort. So there's a lot more emphasis and they could be available, more readily available to you. Whereas here in the middle school, so I'm an instructional facilitator for ELA and a BT mentor, and so I find it hard for myself because I'm also trying to teach, to make sure that I'm hitting all of my BTs and then I'm hitting all of the ELA teachers. So I don't feel like they have as much support as what elementary teachers have.
Laura:
Okay. And when I ask you these questions, I don't want you to focus on you now, I want you to focus on you when you were at Hawkeye, what was the main benefits of instructional coaching for you there?
Amanda Crowder:
I think anytime we had a question, even if she didn't know it, she would find the answer for us, she would help us navigate through struggles that we were having. Like I said, the Read to Achieve first started, I guess you know that, weren't you in elementary? Yes.
Laura:
Yes.
Amanda Crowder:
That was awful because it kept changing. It came out and then they didn't like the way one thing was, and so they changed it. And so we had a lot of support from her, and I think that she helped relieve the stress. I feel like there's a lot of more responsibility on elementary teachers than there are middle school teachers. There's certain paperwork and the district coming in 24 7, she would help us prepare and she would let us know what they wanted, what they were looking for. So she would go to these district meetings and bring back all of the information that we needed. With M Class, she would help us do our assessments so that we could continue to be in the classroom teaching, not losing a whole lot of instructional time.
Laura:
Okay. Now, this is just in your opinion, what do you think could be done to enhance the effectiveness of instructional coaching and supporting teachers?
Amanda Crowder:
Probably maybe that, well, it's kind of hard to say because I feel like maybe if they got more PD on, because some coaches I've noticed they don't really know their roles and expectations. Now, mine at Hawkeye did, but I know a couple others did not. So if they had differentiated PDs based on what their specific schools needed. Because our schools in our area, I mean, you've got one school that's military over there, and then you've got Hawkeye who's way over here. And so I felt like when they would go to these academic coach meetings, they were all getting the same kind of stuff. And the things that Don Steed needed from their academic coach was not the same kind of help that our teachers needed at Hawkeye, because there's totally different caliber of kids and atmospheres and the teachers have to adapt to that. And so I think that that would've been beneficial is for their PDs and the information that they were able to bring back to us was more tailored to the specific school that they worked at.
Laura:
Okay. Do you think instructional coaching has had an impact on your job satisfaction, whether it's positive or negative?
Amanda Crowder:
Yes. Like I said, in elementary at Hawkeye, it was very beneficial. It gave me somebody to rely on if I was feeling stressed or overwhelmed, even if it was just going and having a conversation with her, hey, this is what I'm feeling stressed about, especially as a beginning teacher, she would kind of talk me through it. I know at first I'd be like, when I first started teaching, I'm like, oh, I got to do this, got to do this, got to do this, got to do this. And I was kind of all over the place. And so she was like, "No, make a list. Make a list of your biggest priority and then go down from there." And so she was really good about that.
As far as middle school, before I was an instructional facilitator, I had an instructional facilitator. And like I said, it was there just because it has to be there, but we really weren't worked with a whole lot. I try to hold professional developments with my ELA teachers to help them. I like to ask them, hey, what are you struggling with? What do you need? What do you want to see in this PD? What do you want help with? And then a lot of times I meet with them one-on-one just based off what they need.
And we were actually supposed to get academic coaches in Hope County Middle Schools this year. And I applied and got the one here at West, and then they pulled the funding, so they didn't have the funding for it.So that was fun.
Laura:
Let's see, what else. When you were at Hawkeye and you worked closely with your academic coach, can you share any examples of how it influenced your teaching practice? I mean, I know you kind of talked about that person being a support and bringing back information, but did it impact your teaching practice, the use of instructional strategies or anything like that in your classroom?
Amanda Crowder:
Yeah, I think it did because we would talk about reading strategies that could be used, and she would come in and co-teach with me, and we would do it together and we could plan it together. And then we could talk about what we thought went well, what we thought didn't go well, what could be changed. And then she would come in, maybe watch me and give me feedback on what I could have done differently.
So I don't like it when somebody comes to watch me and doesn't give me any constructive criticism. I can't stand that. I hate it because I'm not perfect, and what you just watched me do wasn't perfect, and I want your help. So she was very honest about that because I needed to know what could I have done different to make that better. So as far as strategies and things like that, once she saw me teach a lesson, she worked with me and then I taught it better the next time.
Laura:
Okay. Awesome. Last question, and we kind of touched on this in our whole group interview, but I just want to know personally, do you believe that instructional coaching has played a role in retaining teachers in the profession?
Amanda Crowder:
I would say yes, just because there's such a support system that it keeps people hanging on. I know BTs, especially in elementary, can really be overwhelmed and not knowing things, just needing that support. And I think my academic coach that I experienced, she did very well with that. She had open door policy. You could go to her anytime. She was always willing to help you. She would come and help you with whatever you needed. And I truly do think that because of her teachers probably did stay.
Nowadays I don't know. It's like an act of congress to get anybody to stay.

Laura:
Okay. So the reason I wanted to ask you some follow-up questions was just because you're moved from pre-K to kindergarten, and I know that you didn't work as much with instructional coaches when you were in pre-K, but you definitely have worked with them a lot more since you moved to kindergarten. What have been the main benefits of having those instructional coaches for you since you made that transition?
Chylene Taylor:
I have somebody to actually go to to bump ideas off with, or if I'm stuck at something, I can go to them and they will help me find a way to help that student or find a resource for me to use to help them.
Laura:
This is just your opinion, but what do you think could be done to enhance the effectiveness of instructional coaches in supporting teachers?
Chylene Taylor:
I think sometimes maybe being more available to us, because they're in so many meetings with other grades or they're off campus doing meetings, so sometimes it'd be nice if they just came and sat, or came and sat some in our rooms more and helped us that way.
Laura:
All righty. Do you think instructional coaching has had an impact on your job satisfaction?
Chylene Taylor:
For kindergarten, yes.
Laura:
Okay. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
Chylene Taylor:
Well, in the past I never had really much support. I had to do it all by myself or just come up with something or look online, and now I actually have people that can find resources for me or come in my room and help me, or I can go to them and they'll sit down and show me different things or show me how to do the paperwork and I'm just not out on my own doing it.
Laura:
Okay. I think specifically since you've moved to kindergarten though, share some specific examples of how instructional coaching has influenced your teaching practice.
Chylene Taylor:
Coming in and watching me teach certain subjects and then us sitting down and talking about how maybe we might be able to switch something or tweak something here and there helps a lot. Just being able to go to them and ask them things helps a lot too. And then doing the little e-tools, they'll come in and observe and then give me a little... right at the bottom, little things that I might be able to change or I was doing good at, so I know what I might need to improve on or what I'm doing okay in.
Laura:
Okay. Last question. Do you think that instructional coaching plays a role in retaining teachers in the profession? Why or why not?
Chylene Taylor:
I would think so because it's another resource teachers can use besides their teammates or outside help with other teachers from other schools. They have somebody right there they can get their hands on or call right away.

Laura: So thanks for agreeing to meet with me again. I just wanted to ask a couple of follow up questions since you’re still a fairly new teacher. Start off by telling me what you perceive to be the main benefits of instructional coaching. 

Dave: Like I said the other day, I wouldn’t have survived last year without our coaches. The biggest benefit for me is the support they give me and the fact that they are not evaluating me. They genuinely want to help me become a better teacher, not just for our students, but for me. 

Laura: That’s great. Thanks for sharing. Do you believe instructional coaching has played a role in retaining teachers in the profession?

Dave: Well like I said, personally I probably wouldn’t still be teaching if I hadn’t had the support of them last year. I wouldn’t say they are the only reason but a really big one. I guess I look at it as they are a part of a support system for all teachers, but particularly important to beginning teachers.  I don’t think administrators would be able to provide the same level of support and encouragement with everything else they have on their plates, so yes. I think ultimately instructional coaching helps keep teachers (especially new ones like me) in the profession. 

Laura: Awesome. In your opinion, what could be done to enhance the effectiveness of instructional coaching?

Dave: I mentioned what administrators have on their plates, but coaches have a lot on theirs as well. They have a lot of responsibilities that sometimes prevent them from being in classrooms. They lead PLC’s, help administer tests, and sometimes have to cover/teach classes. Not saying that these things aren’t important, but if they had more time to be in classrooms it would make them even more effective. 

Laura: Ok…Has instructional coaching had an impact on your job satisfaction?
Dave: Definitely, yes. I think just having those people you can go to when you need immediate help or support. Having those listening ears and people who have been in your shoes before so they can relate. I have good relationships with our coaches and I think that helps with job satisfaction. I don’t see them all the time but I know they are there. 

Laura: Can you share any specific examples of how instructional coaching has influenced your teaching practice? 

Dave: there are too many to list. Our coaches have modeled lessons, co-taught lessons with me and helped me with data analysis and planning appropriate instruction so all of those things have helped me gain confidence and become a more effective teacher. I met growth last year and I know I have to thank my coaches for all of their support.

Laura: ok, last question. How do you believe instructional coaching impacts your professional growth and development?

Dave: Well, I’m an older new teacher and I can only speak for how they have helped me grow over the last two years but I am certain that I’m a better teacher now than I was at the beginning of the year last year because of the help and support they gave me. 
Laura:
I would like for you to describe your experiences with instructional coaching. And anybody can start.
Lauren Comer:
No, you're fine. Can you explain a little more detail who would be the instructional coach type role?
Ashley Weeks:
Right. That was my question.
Laura:
I don't know. We call them instructional facilitators here. I don't know, but do you have a person in your school who just works with teachers, maybe coaching, providing support with planning, curriculum? Anyone like that? I think Lauren's frozen. Sorry about that. Did that clarify for you, Lauren?
Lauren Comer:
Ashley Weeks:
An academic coach?
Laura:
Yes. 
Laura:
Absolutely. Okay. So if you guys call them academic coaches, when we're talking about it, just how you describe your experience with your academic coaches.
Amanda:
So in middle school for ELA, we don't have specific academic coaches. They had talked about doing it this year, but then said there wasn't the funding for it. We did have what you would call an intervention specialist that was supposed to help with things like that, but a lot of times, she was pulled. In elementary school when I worked at Hawk Eye for nine years, there was an instructional facilitator, academic coach, and they did a lot. But I know [inaudible 00:02:40] to know about middle school. So for ELA-
Laura:
No, no, no. Really, any experience you have with an instructional coach or an academic coach. It doesn't have to be in your current position. It can be anywhere.
Amanda:
Oh, okay. So when I was in elementary school, we had a really great one. Her name was Paula [inaudible 00:03:02] and she would do anything from helping with lesson plans, she would help teachers dissect data and use that information for further instruction. She would pull children and work with children based on their data from testing, all kinds of different things. Her hands were full and she really supplemented the teachers, and it was really a great experience for the teachers to have that resource to use.
Lauren Comer:
So in high school, and my situation may be a little specific because I've taught 10th grade for the last two years. So because that's such a vital course, ours doesn't necessarily pull kids out of the class based on data, but ours really focuses heavily on helping us with the curriculum and the standards, and making sure that we all align and we all understand, and just to help bridge some of the barriers. If there's something that we don't feel is our strong point, she can come in and either observe and give feedback or she can come in and show us how to do it.
Speaker 5:
So I've had various academic coaches. Actually, I think I've had a new one every year. And for this year, my current one is amazing because she really gets to know the teacher. So what's the best way for the teacher to learn, and connects, and makes a connection with the teacher. And that's how she helps assist. So it's not a blanket where this is the way she does it every single time for every single teacher. It's exactly like teaching with students. It's however is the best way for you to learn. And that's how she wants, because she wants you to really feel supported as well as learn and be able to grow from it. And she's offered for the school to... If you need help with a certain standard, pulling children, which this is actually the first time that I've experienced that where they were going to pull children and help or do with small groups. That's amazing. And just data, paperwork, anything you need assistance with.
Laura:
Okay.
Ms. Williams:
So I'm here at the high school with Ms. Comer, and we have four instructional facilitators at our school, and I'm one of them. I'm one of the instructional facilitators for the science department. We have a pretty tight-knit group up here. So my job is really just to help out with the teachers. I cater a lot to the new teachers, because most of the classes up here are graduation requirements. So I help them out with their classroom, lesson plans, any resources they need for their classrooms. I do go in and observe them and I asked them, "What you need help with? What do you need me to do?" Try to be there for them all the time. I'm probably really worrisome. But I just know that when I first started, my instructional facilitator wasn't helping me at all, so I had to figure out myself. So I try to be that extra help for them when they need it.
Laura:
Did you teach classes as well or you're just an instructional facilitator?
Ms. Williams:
No, I actually teach classes too. I'm actually an EOC teacher, so I teach biology.
Laura:
Okay.
Lauren Comer:
My instructional facilitator is Ms. [inaudible 00:07:12], and she also teaches classes. I'm pretty sure all of the ones at the high school level, at least at Hoke, I'm pretty sure all of them, for the most part, teach classes as well as mentor all the new teachers.
Ms. Williams:
Yeah, they do give us an extra planning period. We only have two classes, but you really can't get through a lot within those two classes. So, I mean, it doesn't even feel like you get it, but they offer it to us.
Ashley Weeks:
Yeah, I agree with almost everybody. My academic coach or instructional facilitator, she really helps the teachers, mostly new teachers, but she's there to help us make sure we understand curriculum, how to use our data, if we have any issues with any of our in-class or bridges or any of our curriculum, she steps in, helps us out. Account information, if we get a new kid, she works with a data manager and make sure we get all their transfer stuff or if they're a brand new kid, because I'm kindergarten, then we get them set up, get them where they need to be. But she's also... We've gone to her about just classroom management questions or anything that a teacher would need outside of the data. She's there to help. So, very useful. But she also does... She runs AIG, Beta Club. She has some other extracurricular activities outside the school too.
Laura:
Okay. And you guys have talked a little bit about this, but is there any other direct support that you feel like you receive from your school's coach? Anything other than what you guys have talked about already? I know that I was interested, Lauren, you said that they would come in and teach or observe. Do they co-teach with you? Do they model lessons, or maybe not with you but with other teachers?
Lauren Comer:
So like I said, Ms. [inaudible 00:09:21] is my coach for English, and I also have Ms. Mitchell Montgomery, who's right beside me. And so she's a veteran teacher as well. So things like DGP for example, that's not something that I've done very much. I've only been doing it for two years. So if I have questions, I can go to them or have them step over and they'll model it for my kids or they'll just assist me. And since they're so close in the vicinity with where I'm at, it's very easy for them to just pop in or to sit in and see what I need. And Ms. [inaudible 00:09:57] is also really good. She'll send me an email once a week like, "Hey, you good? What do you need? Is there anything that you need help with? Let me know." So she keeps in contact very frequently.
Laura:
Okay. Anybody else? Any other kinds of direct support that you receive from these coaches?
Amanda:
I'm on the curriculum committee for the county and Ms. [inaudible 00:10:22] is on it too. So I've worked with her some. So even though, at West, we don't have a specific instructional facilitator, instructional coach, we are able to work with different instructional coaches throughout the curriculums or throughout the county. So where I'm on the curriculum committee with [inaudible 00:10:43], I am able to work with her. So I'm lead teacher. So for ELA, I do do workshops with the teachers here, and data meetings, and things like that. But my title isn't really instructional facilitator. But because I'm on the curriculum instructional team here, I am the one who gives... I'm only over ELA here, but it's not really an instructional facilitator.
Laura:
Okay. Anybody else? And again, when I'm asking this question, it doesn't have to be with your current person that you work with, but talk to me about ways that instructional coaching may have contributed to your professional growth and development as a teacher. I know when I started teaching, this wasn't even really a thing, so I didn't have that support person in my school. But how do you feel like they have contributed to your professional growth and development or even the professional growth and development of other people in your school?
Lauren Comer:
So I'll go ahead and say this is only my third year of teaching. So my first year of teaching was really just survival, it was not mastering... And it was the year we all came back from COVID was my first year. So it genuinely was survival. It was not mastering the skills or really knowing how to do it. It was just getting through. And I think that the district does try to prepare you, but a lot of the people within the district haven't been in the classroom for some time. So I feel like there's some gaps as far as the preparations when you're coming in. So you're just thrown into the classroom. And so I feel like these people are extremely important because they understand what it is that the district needs from us, but they're still within the classroom so they understand what we need as well.
And so they're very good at saying like, "Okay, this feeling is completely normal. It's okay. Focus on this." My first semester, I can remember I was just drowning because I was taking work home every single day, working after, and Ms. [inaudible 00:13:11] finally told me one day, she was like, "If you can't complete it during school, save it for the next day, you're drowning yourself. Don't take it home with you like that." And so I try my best now. I still work at home sometimes, but if I can save it for the next day, I will. And so just those little tips and tricks because, like I said, these people are still within the classroom so they know what it's like sometimes more than the district for those people who have been out for a while.
Laura:
Okay. Anybody else?
Lauren Comer:
Yeah, I like to add to that. Yeah, I'm sorry. I wanted to add to that because I am the instructional facilitator for the science department, but I'm also a mentor and I like to be honest, I'll be having a rough day, take a break. A student gives you a hard time, come sit in my classroom, just to give you a break. Because like I said, when I first started, I had no help. I didn't know nothing. I started from page one and went all the way to the end until they told me to stop. I didn't know nothing, okay? I didn't know what a curriculum was, I didn't know what pacing was, so I didn't know. So I tried to be that extra help for people on my team.
One thing that I learned when I got here, I've been for 13 years, but when I first got started and once they realized that I didn't know what I was doing, my mentor at the time told me to do some professional development to help me learn to read my standards so that I know what I'm teaching. Because if I'm teaching the EOC class, I definitely need to know what I'm teaching. So I did a PD on station rotation. It was learning to read your standards, to be able to give your students assignments that are relevant to what they need to learn. And that was the biggest eye-opener for me because, "What do I want to give the students some assignments and it's irrelevant to what they need to know at the end?" And so even though they don't offer that PD anymore. But I do tell my mentees to read their standards and read it closely and make sure that whatever you give to them is something that's relevant to what they need to know. So be intentional.
Laura:
Absolutely.
Amanda:
And to piggyback off what she said, I think one good thing about a great instructional facilitator, well, that I've seen throughout my elementary since I don't have one now, is constructive criticism. I think it's important for them to have that. And I've seen that with them. You don't want the one to sugarcoat it and tell you what you want to hear. They'll tell you what you need to hear. And I've had some good ones that did that and I've had some ones that they just tell you what you want to hear and they're not really helping out. And I think being completely honest with them is what you have to do.
So I'm a BT mentor just like Ms. Williams is, and when I began being a BT mentor, that is one thing that I did struggle with, and that's one thing that I've had to work on myself because I realized that if I wasn't telling them in a nice polite way what they could be doing better, then they weren't learning anything from me. So being able to have that within an instructional facilitator, academic coach, I think is a very important piece and you have to be able to give that constructive criticism or be able to receive it. So I know when I wasn't BT, we had a floating instruction facilitator, academic coach.
And then once we got one full time, I could see a huge difference in the things that she was able to do to be able to help all teachers, even the veteran teachers, I know a lot of times that because I've been in the county for 14 years and I was at Hawk Eye for the first nine. So even when I had been teaching for nine years, I would still go to her for things and information like, "What can I do about this? What can I do about that? I don't think I'm teaching this standard effectively." And she would come in and watch me, "Well, I think you could have done this different." And then she would also model lessons for me. So those are just some of the experiences that I have in that I try to use now as being a BT mentor.
Speaker 5:
I think to follow up with what she just said is that is for myself as a BT is the biggest impact that anyone has ever made with me as a mentor or a teacher is, well, someone who's positive, who knows how to give like, "Hey, this is where we can... I don't know. The best way I can explain it is Molly Patterson. She's a very positive person. And for myself, when I was a BT, if I was given feedback in a different way where I would actually... Just a student shut down inside, because I felt like I wasn't good enough or I wasn't doing well. I felt like a failure. So the way it is presented is definitely key because there are certain people that almost wanted me like, "Please, come in my room. Tell me more. How can I grow more?" And then there were some times where I was like, "Oh, no. Please, walk past my room."
Amanda:
Yeah. Fortunately for me, Molly was in the county when I first started. And obviously, I didn't know her that well because I had not lived here that long because I moved here for the teaching job. And then when I met my husband, Quame and Molly... This is going to tell the age gap between us. But Quame and Molly were my husband's teachers. So I felt like... Yeah, there's an age gap there. So they were his teachers, and so that's how I met them, because he knew them really well. And so I felt comfortable going to Molly and asking her questions and I knew I wouldn't be judged. So luckily for me... She was not my direct academic coach, but she was a personal academic coach that I felt comfortable enough as a BT to go to and talk to.
Speaker 5:
She wasn't my direct either, but when she would come into my room, I was like, "Yes, she's here." I would be very excited when-
Amanda:
Saved by the bell.
Speaker 5:
Yes.
Speaker 5:
And I learned something about myself at the same time. So there is a way of delivering that, an instructional coach too, is make you want to learn more just like a student. We are, as teachers, what we do for our students.
Laura:
And again, some of this is maybe a little bit repetitive, so don't feel like you have to say the same things over, but how has instructional or have instructional coaches helped you just address challenges as a teacher? I mean, I know that there's so many that we face in education every day, but how has having an instructional coach, whether you have one now or in the past, how has that helped you address challenges that you faced in your job?
Ashley Weeks:
I think it really helps us reflect on how we are as a teacher, [inaudible 00:21:35] peers or on our team. I know our instructional coach or academic coach, she always gives us positive feedback, but also gives us constructive criticism like the girls were saying. But I think it makes you take a step back when you hear it coming from somebody who cares about you being at the school, they're always there for you, good or bad, or just to have a breather or talk to. So I think just having them there makes you really think about as a person and a teacher, "What can I do to be better?" Even if they say, "Your lesson went great, the walkthrough was good," you always can reflect on it. Just knowing you have somebody there that you can go to, not the principal, not the assistant principal, but somebody that has been in your position. Our coach, she was a kindergarten, first grade teacher, so I can connect to her. But I do think they help us reflect, definitely.
Lauren Comer:
Piggybacking onto that as well. I'll also say, like she said, they know you very well. So, me, sometimes I can be quick to react to situations, and Ms. [inaudible 00:22:54] knows that. So sometimes having her or having any type of mentor there, sometimes they know a better way of going about a situation or they know a better way to address a certain person because maybe they've worked with that person longer, and so they can sometimes mediate or you can bounce students to them, that type of situation, just to help you take a second so you can get yourself back together.
Amanda:
I think one thing, talking about the challenges, I think BTs have challenges and I think even a 14-year teacher has challenges and obviously there are different ones working with different age groups. But I think them having experience, like she said, and I think... [inaudible 00:23:51] scenarios like, "Have you ever had a kid do this," or, "Have you ever had a problem doing this? Have you ever struggled with teaching this standard?" And them being able to give me, "Yeah. One time, I was struggling with this and this is what I did that worked," or, "This is what I did and it didn't work. Might work for you, but it didn't work for me." So I think just being able to talk to them and being open with them about what your challenges are, then them being able to help you and help you come up with ideas, even if it's something they've never done before, being able to figure it out with you, being by our sides and us being able to trust them and go to them with our challenges.
Laura:
Anybody else?
Ms. Williams:
I agree. I agree. I definitely think it's important that we try to make them comfortable being a teacher, especially with the students, "I think you're perfect. You're a genius. You know it all." And then if I mess up, it's like, "Oh, the end of the world." But letting them know that it happens. The best of us... I have a good habit of saying, "Look, I don't know. Okay? We're going to figure it out together." And I let them know that sometimes we don't have it all together, and it's okay. "I don't know this answer, I don't know how to teach this and that's my job to try to help you. And sometimes I still don't know, but we're going to figure it out." But I think it's important that we try to make them comfortable and let them know that challenges do come, and we can work through them, and we can try to do the best we can to make it better for us.
Amanda:
Well, and in that, since you are an academic coach and instructional facilitator, I remember when I first started teaching, and my academic coach would say that to me like, "I don't know, but we're going to get it. We're going to figure it out." It would make me be like, "Okay, I'm not the only one." It was like I was relieved that I felt like, "Okay, I'm a BT and I don't really know this yet, but she doesn't know it either, but we're going to get it." So it just made me feel better like, "Oh, I'm not the only one who is struggling with this here."
Laura:
So do you feel like your coaches are... I mean, I know that beginning teachers need more support, but do you feel like the coaches are as available and helpful for veteran teachers or just more focused on the beginning teachers?
Amanda:
Well, for me, once again, I was at elementary, since we don't have one, I felt like she was a little more towards the BTs, but almost just as equally as veterans. Because things are ever-changing, and even my ninth year, there were things that changed. And not many years after I started, they come out with that Read to Achieve, and Lord, have mercy. That was a challenge at first. So even though I had been teaching longer than some of the teachers, she was helping us with that. Even at nine years, I don't think she ever pushed me off to help a BT. I think she was pretty much equally as involved. She wasn't going to not help her veterans just to help her BTs, I mean, because let's be honest, sometimes veterans need more help than BTs, and it is what it is.
So I felt like she was really good about... And sometimes she would have meetings with all of us because we can always learn all the time. I know when I work with BTs and ELA people on campus... It's not just my BT, ELAs. I invite all of them, because even sometimes even I can learn from a BT who just is freshly out of school because they may have just learned something, a trick or something that I don't even know about. But I feel like for the most part, the two different academic coaches that I had, they weren't all just concerned about the beginning teachers. I think they were also working with their veteran teachers as well.
Lauren Comer:
Also, I'm going to add to that... And I speak for English, but I'm sure science, especially at the high school, which I'm sure it's the same everywhere as well. But I feel like we also have such a shortage at this point that everyone needs a little bit of assistance and it's just one of those characteristics of the people that fill these mentor roles to be helpful. So they'll give additional help to the newer teachers, but like you said, if veterans need it, they're there for it. It's just all about making sure that everybody is doing what they need to do and making sure everybody has the most efficient way to do it. And if there's a better way, they'll give the advice to whoever wants it and is receptive of it.
Laura:
Okay. Really just one more question, and then if there's anything else y'all want to share, I'll give you the opportunity to do that. But talk to me about factors that have led to your decision to remain in teaching, and particularly, if having direct support from a coach has impacted your decision to remain in education. I'm curious to know if instructional coaching can aid in retaining teachers, if that makes sense. But why did we decide to stay in education? We know it's really hard.
Amanda:
I stay in education because I love kids. It ain't for the money, it ain't for... We have a lot of work to do. I just love kids that much. And I think kids, especially around our area, are in need of a good education. Now, we have a lot of full-time subs, and I just feel like that if I can help these students become more successful, then that is what I want to do. So really the main reason that I am still teaching is because I love children. I love these babies, and I don't want to leave them. But as far as the academic coaching, being able to help, I think it does make it easier when you feel like you have somebody on your side and they're there to support you and there to help you. It does help a lot with things, whatever it is that you have going on. But the main reason I'm still in teaching is because I just love the kids too much to walk away.
Ms. Williams:
I agree. I just love teaching. I mean, it's getting different every year, but I still love doing it. I did have... I wouldn't say that this person was an instructional facilitator or academic coach. They was just a leader in the school and they just say, "Keep going. Keep going further because you're good at this, and teachers really are receptive to you." So I took that as a push. So I'm actually going to get my doctorate right now in curriculum and instruction because I feel like this is what I'm supposed to be doing. So I think it's just a little bit of [inaudible 00:32:04] that I advise a teacher to keep going, to keep doing this. One of my mentees is actually going to get her masters, because she didn't think she's going to like teaching, but she does. So she's going further. So I'm hoping maybe I had a little bit of impact on that.
Ashley Weeks:
And that's awesome, Ms. Williams, congratulations. And Ms. Williams, being an instructional facilitator, I will say it is very important, I think, to have an encouraging person in your corner. And my academic coaches, and I know a lot of other ones are too, and I think that's what helps keep teachers, even if they're... Especially good teachers. Teachers that... This is your passion. Like, Amanda, this is what you want to do, you're calling. [inaudible 00:32:53] your corner, really just telling you, "You are so good at this. Look how you're helping your other teammates, your older grade teachers, younger grade teachers, and all the kids, parents," I think that helps keep us in and definitely helps us keep going. We know that we're appreciated by not just the principal, assistant principal, your teammates, but somebody that really knows what you're doing exactly every day because they know what's on your [inaudible 00:33:25].
Amanda:
Yeah. And I think, like what Ms. Williams said, is she had somebody to encourage her. I think it's really good when we have those people to encourage you to go further and if this is really what you want to do to build yourself up and be where you want to be. So I think those things like that really help out teachers, beginning ones, and some that they don't know that this is what they want to do, but maybe they end up being really good at it. And hearing that, especially if their love language is words of affirmation, just continuing hearing, "Hey, you got this, you're doing what you're supposed to do. Keep going. Keep pushing. You got this," I think that really helps retain teachers. And most of the time, the academic coaches are those people, and you have people like that that push you to be better.
Even though my principal is not an academic coach, she is one heck of a principal and she is constantly encouraging people to go further. She will look at a teacher and see their strengths and see their weaknesses. She's our principal and our instructional facilitator, academic coach, confidant, mentor, whatever. Some people think she's tough, but I have absolutely loved working for her. There has been times she's been tough on me, and at first, I'm really upset, and then I go back and think about it and I'm like, "Every single thing that she just said is nothing but to make me a better teacher. Nothing. She's only trying to help." And she's even asked me before, "Do you want to go to school to be a principal?" And I'm just like, "I love the kids too much. I can't walk away from the kids. I don't want to be out of a classroom away from children."
Laura:
Anybody else?
Laura:
Just in closing, is there anything else that you guys would like to share about your experience with an academic coach, instructional coach, however you want to phrase it? It's okay if not. Okay, I'm going to stop the recording now.
Laura:
You're fine. I wanted to ask you just a couple of follow up questions. One of the things that intrigued me from our interview the other day was, just you moving from a middle school to a high school. Going from a school that you had an academic coach to, one where you didn't initially. But also, the thoughts of you being lateral entry because I feel like that's a more common occurrence these days. So what have been the benefits for you of working with your academic coach? And you can, I think, probably more what I'd like you to focus on is when you were at the middle school in that lateral entry role.
Kyle Pillar:
Sure. Let me shut my door real quick. Yeah, so the benefit of that from the lateral entry perspective was that, I guess, like I said the other day, I had zero experience. I had journalism school under my belt and teaching was just going to be like, really, I'll be honest, I got a job to teach so that I can move and be with my fiance. I mean, that's what it was. And then it turned into a career path. So it helped me because, like I mentioned the other day, it was all about just getting that foundation. Learning what is a lesson plan at that point. What's a learning target, what's a I can statement, all of that. And it really did help. I mean, I didn't know what the term Lexile meant. I mean, there was just so much that it was just every day I was in Angela McDonald's office and there were others too.
I was allowed to leave school once a week because I was the only ELA teacher, eighth grade ELA teacher. I went to Hamlet middle once a week to plan with other people, and I worked. So I guess that's another element. I worked with their academic coach too. And not as much or as frequently, but Michelle Burns, I don't know if you know her. She was one who, she was the academic coach at Hamlet at the time. And so I got to double dip there. And like I said, it was just the foundations that essentially things that I still used today from lesson planning to organization, to understanding curriculum, all of that.
Laura:
Okay. That kind of answers another one of my questions. Any other ways that it's influenced your teaching practice in terms of instructional strategies and things like that that you use in the classroom?
Kyle Pillar:
Definitely in that middle school setting, we were stations based. Everything for, I don't think middle schools are still a lot of stations. So I think that was another thing that Angela helped me with there was to understand not just the plant stations, but to have diversity and to have different activities and to use small group settings and all of that. I would probably say that's the biggest instructional strategy out of that.
Laura:
Okay. And this is strictly opinion question, and it doesn't reflect on your instructional coach or anything at all, but what do you think could be done to enhance the effectiveness of instructional coaching and supporting teachers?
Kyle Pillar:
I think it's a gray area of, we know what they are and we know what they're capable of. And I think in our situation here, I'm really good friends with our academic coach outside of work here. She was in my wedding and she's best friends with my wife. And so I love her to death, but at the same time, it's like, I don't have a clear expectation of what it is that she's doing here, for me. I understand that she helps Ms. McCray with run PBIS and run PLCs.
And I know that I could go to Becky anytime I needed her for data analysis. And at this point, a lot of that stuff I'm able to do on my own. I can look at my own data. But I think from some of the beginning teachers, we have quite a few in the building. I'm guessing that because there's not like a schedule or we're a big enough school that you can't catch her all the time if you stop by her office. So I think to come back to answer the question, to make them more effective, let there be, I don't want to say like a schedule, but something of that sort. Do you know what I mean? Or understand what they're...
Laura:
Maybe more clearly defined.
Kyle Pillar:
I have too many things in my head to remember that. But it sounded like their academic coaches have had a variety of roles that ours haven't or mine have the same. Or maybe theirs doesn't help with PBIS, but ours does. So I just think, within whatever school setting they're in, just have, like you said, a more clearly defined, this is what we're doing or this is what the expectations are, and this is how you can use this person to help you.
Laura:
Yeah, I can see that even in my that I think a lot of it depends on how the principal utilizes the people in the school, and that varies from school to school. So yeah, I could definitely see that. And I think you've kind of alluded to this, but do you feel like instructional coaching has had an impact on your job satisfaction, whether it be positive or negative?
Kyle Pillar:
I'd say so. Teaching's crazy. Education's crazy. It's gotten crazier since I started. And I think there's a part of, maybe not so much anymore, but my first four years that I taught middle school, I think it definitely had a profound impact. Again, I keep stressing going back to that foundation, but I definitely think that they are positions that they should remain a position. I think even if they're not helping on a daily basis with instruction or in the classroom stuff, I mean, right now ours is helping us with the learning focus transition. So I'm actually, I mentioned the other day I had Dr. Smith come in Monday, or it was sometime last week because I want to do it right. I'm stuck between this whole learning goals and learning activities and that kind of thing.
So Becky was in here. And so I think there is some benefit to that now that there are new things that we're having to do. And so to simply answer your question, yes, I think there's a positive impact. And if you're willing to use what they give you. Some teachers aren't willing to dive deep in the whole learning focused thing because they're in year 27, and I don't blame them. But for somebody like me in year nine, yeah, it's definitely something that's beneficial.
Laura:
Okay. Last question. Do you think that instructional coaching plays a role in retaining teachers in the profession? Why or why not?
Kyle Pillar:
Not as much. I think that they can, but I'm trying to think because it's crossed my mind many a times of leaving not just Richmond County to move home, but leaving the profession altogether. And I don't think I've ever once thought of, boy, I'm going to miss my academic coach. But, at the same time, I guess, you could just include the academic coach into your school support team. Do I want to come back to another year of craziness? And that's why I keep coming back here is because I have such a great English department. They were going to move us the high school next year or the year after next, and Mr. Pillar might be looking for another school because I really don't want to go to Richmond because I like what we have here. So I think it can go both ways. If your academic coach has had a big enough impact on you during your time there, perhaps that they could influence your decision.

Laura:
Okay. So what do you think have been the main benefits for you to have your academic coach working with you as a new teacher?
Lauren Comer:
I would definitely say just being able to explain stuff because, especially in my first year, not coming from an education background, what I really struggled with was understanding how connections happened with assignments and standards. For example, the first year they set me up teaching debate, and there's no curriculum provided for that. There's not really any standards for that. So it was literally just me pulling like Googling, "Okay, what do I teach for debate? Okay, let me go on teacher, pay teacher, and find stuff." So it was really a struggle to figure out that connection. So it was really necessary to have that academic coach to step in and be like, "Hey, this is how this connects. Okay, here's how we do this." So that's what I really struggled with is connecting assignments and standards.
Laura:
Okay. So what do you think, and this is just your opinion, could be done to enhance the effectiveness of instructional coaching to support teachers? What do you think would make it better?
Lauren Comer:
So honestly, I don't even know if this really falls on the academic coach, but I would just say the training as I was coming in as a new teacher, the training that they provided for us, they cover a lot. And they have exercises and stuff within the county that you do at your little meet and greets, those first three days of training. And it's very overwhelming, and they use a lot of teacher jargon. And if you're not from a teacher background, you don't really understand any of it. So they try their best to prepare you, but it doesn't really prepare you. But as far as academic coaches, I feel like they do their job because ,like I said the other day, they're still in education, so they fully understand what it is that you're going through and everything. So I feel like they're very effective. I just think there's miscommunication or a lack of connection between the county training and new teachers.
Laura:
So one thing that was interesting to me was that you guys use teachers to do this as well. Do you think it would enhance the effectiveness if they didn't have to teach classes so that they could focus? My instructional coaches don't teach here. So, I mean, what are your thoughts there?
Lauren Comer:
I'd say yes and no, because it would be more effective, as in, it would give them more time to do things and that sort of thing like prepare things, check in. But like I said, with the training that they provide through the county, the people who do the training, they haven't been in the classroom in a while. And so I feel like once you've been out of the classroom for a little bit, you need a refresher because the kids change so much. And so I feel like yes and no, it would be effective. They would just still need exposure to the classroom, I feel, to be effective for new teachers.
Laura:
Gotcha. So, how would you describe the impact that it has had on your job satisfaction?
Lauren Comer:
Oh, I would definitely say it's fantastic. Completely satisfied. My first year of teaching was definitely survival, just drowning, but just floating through the whole year to get to the end. And I had an academic coach that helped me at that time, but it was still very much a struggle. And as I've gotten super close with my academic coach over the last two years, it has really improved and just kind of helped my understanding. And I'm just able to go to her with any questions that I have and be like, "Hey, I need help."
Laura:
Okay. And I think you kind of touched on the specific examples of how they've influenced, but now that you're in year three, right?
Lauren Comer:
Mm-hmm.
Laura:
Okay. So you talked a little bit about how they helped you understand the connection between the standards and all that stuff, but how do you feel like it impacts your teaching practice now as a year three teacher?
Lauren Comer:
So I'm probably a little different than some people because my academic coach is also my PLC leader. We teach the same grade in the same section. So we meet once a week for our PLCs. And so we make connections then like, "Okay, are we all on this certain area of the unit? Okay, do we fully understand the tone, the figurative language? Do we fully understand the themes that we're going to be teaching?" And we just kind of go over those things and just make sure that we're all on the same page, that nobody has any questions, and we just feed off each other with different ideas or teaching practices that work for us or our kids. And so that's how I would say it's really affected. To begin with, like I said, I didn't understand the connection between assignments and standards. And as my understanding has expanded, it's just kind of been adding on little tips and tricks here and there and making me better, I'd say by year three.
Laura:
Okay. Last question. Do you think that instructional coaching has played a role in retaining teachers in the profession? Maybe not you, but I know when you talk about why teachers leave the profession, I mean, a lot of them say it's because of lack of support. So, do you feel like instructional coaching could have played a role in retaining teachers in the profession, and why or why not?
Lauren Comer:
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely, I would say, because I feel like a lot of the issue with the lack of support it's not because they don't have these academic coaches. I would say it's a lack of connection within the county and sometimes the higher-ups. And I know me, for example, I had some issues last year because I'm getting reimbursed for grad school. Well, there was some issues with the connection between the county and me with getting my pay my reimbursement for that. So they were literally two semesters behind on paying me, and I was extremely frustrated, and I was just kind of over it. And so having that academic coach that I could go to...
And Bridget Parnell as well, she was amazing and was so influential with talking to me and kind of coaching me through it because I was just fed up at that point. So having those people to lean on, I think they definitely kind of helped retain and keep teachers because, I mean, I was at the point where I was just kind of done with it, and those were the people that really brought me back and were like, "Okay, let's take these steps. Let's see what we can do to fix this problem." And they kind of also are veterans, so they know the people to go to for the help too.

Laura:
All right. I just have really six questions and anybody can answer. If you want to add on to something that someone else has said, that is fine too. But the first one would be how you would describe your experiences with instructional coaching. And it doesn't have to be just in your position now, it can be at any point in your career that you've worked with an instructional coach, but just talk to me about your experiences with instructional coaches.
Heather Clemmons:
Kyle and I have the same kind of experience. We're both at the Ninth Grade Academy, and we did not get an instructional coach until Kyle, was it three years ago?
Kyle Pillar:
Yeah, this is our third year with ones.
Heather Clemmons:
If I'm on year 24, I've had an instructional coach three years. This is our second one. We don't have a whole lot of experience with an academic coach.
Laura:
Do you feel like it's changed anything that you've done or changed your satisfaction with your job in any way just having that extra support?
Heather Clemmons:
I can't say that it has, but I think it might. If I were at a different stage in my career and being a high school math, I think it would be hard. It's been helpful to maybe learn more about the district initiatives, things like that. But as far as my teaching process, oh well, no. That might be implemented in the district initiatives. I can't say that it has helped a whole lot, but I'm not saying that they don't do a good job at what they do.
Kyle Pillar:
Yeah, I came in lateral entry in 2015 at LRB Middle. So I've had an academic coach my entire nine years. Well, with the exception, well, there were probably a two year gap at ninth grade that I didn't have one. But I lived in Angela McDonald's office my first year, and she was fantastic. She was my academic coach then at LRB, and I would say kind of looking at it through a different lenses of PT, it definitely helped with everything Heather mentioned about district initiatives and just on the whole understanding what is teaching and all of that. But to kind of piggyback off of what Heather said, the high school level, not so much.
Lauren Parker:
I just started teaching, this is year seven for me, so I've been at the elementary school level all seven years. I can also agree with Kyle in my first two years, my first year I was one of five brand new teachers right out of college. The whole team was brand new right out of college. So I think we underwent our own challenges as five brand new teachers. But we lived in the academic coaches' office every afternoon from August until January 31st of our first year, and we stayed every single day. It was mandatory till five o'clock. And we were planning with our math district person, which was Kelly DeLong at the time, and our ELA person that was Donna Gephardt at the time. And I think it helped understand the processes and what things should look like to yield best practices and get best small group results and how to grow kids.
But we also, for the past, I've been at Washington Street all six years, the last five, well four and a half, we had an amazing academic coach that would bend over backwards. Anything you asked her, she had an answer or she had a resource or something like that for you. We have a brand new academic coach this year, and their styles are different. I think the help is there, but you just have to be very specific in what you want from her. It's not so much of a give, a give, a give, a give. She'll do her best to help you with what she can, but the experiences in the past couple of years have been different.
Laura:
Now did you go to college to teach?
Lauren Parker:
Yes.
Susan Powers:
I'm at the same school as Lauren, and I mean, I think overall, whether I was in Scotland or Richmond County, I think they were helpful, but kind of like Lauren said that depending on the actual academic coach, the one we have this year's new, so she's learning. Those that have been in it for a while, I think they provide more because they know more. But overall I would say that they have been more helpful to try to keep us on track and inform us about stuff that we might not know, that kind of thing. I would say helpful.
Laura:
The next question is just what kind of direct support do you receive from your school's instructional coach? And this doesn't, I mean, what Lauren was saying, obviously I'll pull some of that with help with planning, at least when you were a new brand new teacher. But as of now, what kind of support do you receive from your coach on a daily or weekly or even monthly basis? How do they support you?
Lauren Parker:
Ours are like check ins I guess, if you will, or pulse checks. We meet once a week, and ours are set up on rotations. It's supposed to be, I think the first week of the month is instruction, talking about EQs, how they're annotated and that type of thing, and what goes along with our two new curriculums and how we're implementing it. And then week two is starting to look at who's struggling and what students are kind of red flags for us in both reading and math and working along with the MTSS process. And then usually the third and fourth week are starting to look at data because we're usually finishing a unit, one math. We finish a unit every couple weeks or every week or every two weeks. So it kind of just depends. But with reading with our new curriculum, the whole school is on the same unit with the same essential question. It's just talk differently obviously amongst the grade levels.
I think with our PLCs, like they just kind of pulse check us to see how it's going or how we're teaching our curriculums and what supports do we need, who's struggling? Are we going to tier anybody or what resources do we need to support students? And then also kind of keeping us up to date usually with whatever upcoming dates are coming up and how it impacts our team.
Heather Clemmons:
And that's basically the same as what we have our leads, our PLCs. And this year mainly we've been doing a lot with the district initiatives just to see where we are. One thing that's really helped was helping us identify kids and doing the tier, the MTSS. That's what she's been doing. So that's been a huge help. Tracking kids, we do that a lot. She's in charge of our PBIS stuff and all the social events that go along with that.
Kyle Pillar:
I was just going to say recently this past week we had our district walk through, and then the following day our curriculum director came and observed my class per request and our academic coach was in there and she debriefed with me afterwards and we went over stuff. Its been nice to have that, but aside from what Heather mentioned on the weekly PLC setting, we don't have a lot of interaction with her.
Susan Powers:
Yes.
Laura:
And I guess Heather, this one might not be one for you as much because you're just now getting one pretty late in your career, but in what ways do you think that instructional coaching has contributed to your professional growth and development and Lauren, I think you touched on that a little bit earlier as well, but particularly you too Kyle being a lateral entry teacher, how do you think that it contributed to your growth as a teacher?
Kyle Pillar:
Yeah, I came in, I didn't know anything about teaching. I went to journalism school, so I knew the English content pretty quickly. But yeah, our academic coach then was Angela McDonald, and I think it just kind of laid the foundation. I didn't know what our course of study was or what standards were. And through that first year, year and a half through the academic coach position especially, I got to learn that. And yeah, like I said, just kind of set the foundation for where I am today. And as we transition to learning focused and there are parallels there, but all of that stuff kind of just comes back to use and you reuse those skills to learn the learning focused.
Laura:
Lauren, did you have anything to add to what you said earlier just about how it impacted your growth as a teacher?
Lauren Parker:
Coming in brand new, I mean obviously you know about the North Carolina state standards and everything, but we really spent time with dissecting them and alignment. And we actually made our lesson plans. Before when I first started, obviously we followed North Carolina State curriculum, but we did not have i-Ready and benchmark that we have now. We didn't have two concrete, I guess programs. When I first started, it was a district read aloud. They had chose complex read alouds for reading that they thought that were diverse, great vocab, hit language standards, writing standards, those types of things. But I mean, that was kind of all you were given. And you could go on our Google site and you could get the standards that they thought went with that book. But as a brand new teacher, you're given four standards in a book and say, here you go.
I mean, what do you want me to do with it? You want me to read it? And then who was the character, who was the problem? Those kinds of things. I think it really helped me understand, I really learned a lot about lesson planning and what your APs were and how to make a correct exit ticket and how to really understand if students were understanding what I was teaching and then also how to know who was struggling but also struggling because maybe I wasn't teaching it the correct way. Was a student not always just struggling because there was a disability, but maybe what I was doing, I didn't really know how to differentiate my instruction. I knew how to pick different level math worksheets and that type of thing. But as far as how to differentiate and meet the needs of all the students in your classroom, I think in my first couple of years, like my academic coach, it was Martha Butler, she's amazing.
I attribute a lot of success in my career to her. She never didn't have an answer, and if she didn't have an answer, then she was reaching out to the appropriate resources to find it for you. But just how to look at assessments, how to make rubrics of how kids scored on things and how you would tier those children or group those children. She has a vast, vast, vast majority of phonics knowledge. So knowing, breaking it down to certain types of words and what kind of students needs to be and what groups based on their struggles, just always super, super knowledgeable and really knew how to help me not only teach, but how to guide my instruction and how to differentiate it and extend it for all your learners in the classroom because I think when you go to school to be a teacher, you don't know.
You just see the tip of the iceberg. You have no idea what you're actual... I guess when I came to Richmond County, just the mass differentiation of needs in our county and the different levels of children that we have and how do you reach those children? What am I going to do when they don't understand? So just like what Kyle said, I attribute a lot of my success in becoming a new teacher within my first three years. I mean, I spent a lot of time with Martha every day PLC and every day after school.
Laura:
Okay, thank you. How does it help you address challenges as a teacher now if you're facing a challenge and you're unsure, how does your academic coach help you address those challenges now?
Lauren Parker:
I think you have to know exactly what you're asking, that's how I feel anyway. You have to have your problems or whatever, kind of pretty specific. And I feel like instead of being as broad, you really have to have a specific skill or a specific area of need when I go to my academic coach and ask. And I think we're given a lot more resources now, whereas before it was more hands-on. I don't see my academic coach in my classroom that often. It's most of the time asking them, I'm having this issue. It's kind of hard to explain. Do you think you could kind of come and watch and see what you notice? But what Susan said, I think this is her first year as an academic coach, so I think she's trying to learn exactly where and what, and we have several, well, not several anymore, I guess we only have two. We have a long-term sub in second grade, and we have a brand new teacher in second grade.
I think sometimes she spends a lot of her time pulling groups for those teachers and keeping up with their progress monitoring through M class, keeping up with their i-Ready assessments. I'm not going to say she's not helpful, but I think now that I have to have a lot more knowledge about what's going on in my room and I have to come with her with a specific issue and say, "All right, I've tried this, this and this. I'm still drawing blanks or I'm still not getting exactly where I need to get now. What's your suggestion?" Or sometimes district resources, I go to her for resources about maybe things that I just don't know to try or know where they're located. I guess I have more specific questions like that, helping find appropriate resources.
Susan Powers:
Can I add to what Lauren said?
Heather Clemmons:
Sure.
Susan Powers:
Since we're at the same place, I feel like more this year, and probably it's because she is a new academic coach, it's more of a PD session than a professional development session than it is like Lauren was saying, how you got to know what you need to go talk to her versus before it was more like, let me give you this because I think you guys are going to need this. And it's probably like I said, because she's new, but we get more PD I feel like more now than what we had in the past.
Laura:
Okay.
Heather Clemmons:
And I think that's what we have. I don't think my academic coach has been in my room maybe once or twice this year. And I mean, that's fine. And she might be in other classes that are new teachers, I'm not sure. But for the most part, our contact with during PLC's, and if we need anything, we would go to her, but for us, it would be hard for her to create an assignment or she might could lead us to something. But I think just high school was just so different. In fact, one of my other math teachers, she was an elementary teacher and she said the academic coach in the elementary setting is so needed where she says that it's different in high school, you just don't rely on them as much. But she said, we could not have done it without our academic coach in the elementary setting. It's just different.
Laura:
I taught English when I was in a high school setting. If I had become a coach, I have basic knowledge of math and science and social studies, but do I really consider myself an expert to be able to go and help a math teacher? I mean, now granted, I think good teaching practices are good teaching practices and implementing sound instructional strategies in a classroom, I could help any teacher or subject, but in terms of the content and the standards, I wouldn't be able to assist you as much in math because I have an English background. I think that that probably makes it a little different. And even when I was an elementary principal, I had two coaches, but I was very strategic in hiring them because one was that math grounded person and the other was the ELA, and they both helped anybody who needed it. But we kind of had those two experts, so to speak, in those subject areas. And I feel like that's a little harder to do in the secondary level. Kyle, did you have anything to add there or pretty much what Heather said?
Kyle Pillar:
No, I'm on board with Heather. I agree that coming from middle school, even in the middle school setting, it felt much more needed than the high school level. And yeah, I agree with Heather.
Laura:
Okay. I think some other people that I've talked to, I've talked about just... And this goes back to something that Lauren said about having a permanent sub and a new teacher on her team, but I think that the role of the coach depends a little bit on the staff that they're working with and the level of experience they have. And so sometimes they may be called on to do things like testing, like M class testing that aren't necessarily something that would be in their typical job description, but because we have somebody out or whatever, this is what needs to be done. And so they're kind of doing... And I think it's gotten even worse since COVID, just them being pulled in a lot of different directions. Would you guys agree with that?
Susan Powers:
Yes.
Laura:
Okay.
Lauren Parker:
Our academic coach, she's even helping them with behavior and stuff.
Susan Powers:
Yeah. Jack of all trades.
Laura:
The last question and then I'll give you just a chance to share anything else that you wanted to share, but the last question is talk to me about things that led to your decision to remain a teacher and Heather, I know you did not have an instructional coach early in your career, but for those of you who did, I guess particularly Kyle and Lauren, you've kind of talked about it. Did that instructional coach kind of help you say, "Hey, you know what? I can do this. I want to remain in the profession." Because We know we have a really high turnover rate in teaching. Did having an instructional coach impact your decision to remain a teacher at all?
Lauren Parker:
I think you don't... At least I felt like because in my first couple years how tightly I worked with my academic coach, I think on the days when you were just so done and frustrated, I mean, like I said, we were on a team of five brand new teachers. I think it was just nice to know that there was yes, four other people that were in the same boat that I was. But then even when all of us were just tired out, and I don't want to write one more lesson plan, I do not want to talk about math one more time. I think it was just nice to know that our academic coach was always in those first couple years, I mean, so supportive. If we were at school till 5:30, she was at school till 5:30. She was always available email, phone call, text. In the middle of the day when you were having an issue, she was like, "Y'all call me. I'll come down there to your room. I'll sit in on that small group."
And I think it was just nice and just to be able to have that. When you felt like something was going wrong or wasn't, you talked about it in your group and you thought this was how it was going to roll out and it didn't roll out what you thought in your classroom. My academic coach for those first couple of years, absolutely, she was one that would jump right in with us. I mean, she'd be right here at my guided reading table with me and she'd like, "Hey, let me take over right here at this part." Or "Hey, can I teach this small group today? And you take notes and then we'll kind of debrief this afternoon and then maybe you can take another go at it tomorrow?"
Because I'm much stronger in math than I am in reading. And I just didn't understand some of these kids. I didn't understand how to teach them to read. I mean, I understood how to teach them to read, but it was like, "If you're not getting it, then you're not getting it. What else do I do? I've taught you all the sight words, I've taught you all the things," but it was just always nice to have somebody go to bat for you and be there. She was a teacher, so she knew how it felt. And just having that tool in your toolbox, I guess. She was delighted to be in our classrooms. And if we ever asked, it was never a no. She kept a clipboard of places that she was at every second of the day. And I mean, she was in classrooms or helping teachers constantly. And if she wasn't, then it was because she had some other duties she had to do, testing, she had to cover a teacher because they might've been in an IEP meeting or she was doing a small group with this classroom or whatever.
But yes, I would say if it was not for my academic coach in those first couple years, I would've more than likely threw in the towel because the beginning of teaching is hard.
Laura:
Kyle, what about you?
Kyle Pillar:
Yeah, I agree. When I got started, I thought, how hard is it or how hard will it be to teach these kids? And I started in eighth grade and when I got there, I remember there was some work left over and they were doing basic punctuation and grammar sheets. And I thought, well, this is ridiculous. And my academic coach helped me understand that this is where we are, this is where we have to start with just the level. But to answer the question, yes, I think without the support of an academic coach, and I had a big community. I mean, my wife was a teacher at that time, and that's kind of how I got into it. And so I came home and we had a roommate at the time, and so there's three teachers living in the house and just you're always around it.
You always have the support. You could always ask questions. And I think too, I learned that it was okay to fail and that kind of came through the academic coach because that's who I worked with the most, that you can try this strategy or you can try this lexile text. And even if at the end of the lesson it totally bombed, you could come back and say, "You know what? Well, we tried. Let's make some changes." But yeah, overall, I think in those first couple of years, I'm not from here, so my wife and I very often thought about moving back to Pennsylvania. But here we are almost a decade later and I think we're happy. And I think a lot of that has to do with just being comfortable in the classroom those first couple years,
Heather Clemmons:
My generation with not having academic coaches, my mom was a math teacher. We were at the same school and my stepdad was too. We were all three teaching there together. I've grown up with just education and I just always leaned on other teachers. That's just kind of what we did. And you would get with a strong teacher, they would help you with your discipline, your delivery, content, and we shared everything. I'm from the group I started with, you share everything. You don't hold on to something that... You don't do that. So when we moved to the Ninth Grade Academy, then I was with five other math teachers and we basically, when Common Core came out, we created the curriculum that we teach and we'll have teachers go and come and they're like, I mean, we don't have to make anything? I'm like, "It's made. You don't have to do a thing." I've worked with Kelly for a long time who Lauren was talking about, and she would almost have been like my academic coach even though she was not.
She was our curriculum leader. But I went to her a lot, especially when that whole new curriculum came out. We had to create it, but just not really having an academic coach for only three years, I think they are needed now, especially for new teachers. I don't know if the mindset of teachers, maybe it's changed, but we just always helped each other. That's how I learned what I needed to do or what I didn't need to do.
Laura:
Okay.
Susan Powers:
The question was if academic coaches helped me to help me to decide to remain in the profession, is that what the question was?
Susan Powers:
I would say no, because I'm an old school person too, so I don't remember. I think I've always had an academic coach. I don't know if they were always called academic coaches, but I think I've always had one. But I can't say that they were the reason why I remained in the profession. Craziness would be the reason why. I'm just kidding. No, no. I wouldn't say they would be the reason, but they have helped throughout my career. They have been beneficial and helpful for me.
Laura:
Okay. Does anybody have anything else that you want to share about your experience with coaches before I let you go? And it's okay if you don't.
Lauren Parker:
I say all the time, I hope I can be like my [inaudible 00:29:45], if I ever can be half of what my old academic coach was, I'd be doing something. That woman never didn't have an answer for something. You can ask Susan. I mean, sometimes you would be hesitant to go ask her a question because you knew you would get so many resources and such a plethora of everything that you needed. And even like I said, for her to bend over backwards and say, "I'll come there and do it," it was almost like you were like, "Oh, okay. All right, I'll try that. I'll try that." Almost like you got too much information at times. It'd be like, dang, was there a simple answer to that question? But no, I loved my academic coach. She was amazing. And I think, I'm not saying I don't love mine now. I love the one that we have now, but I think she's just new at it and that she's being pulled in so many different directions with behavior and new teachers and all that kind of thing.
I guess since I'm not a brand new teacher anymore, I guess I'm not directly working with my academic coach as much as I was in my first three years. But I will say that because of my old academic coach, I have looked in to being an academic coach. I think it would be a fun job.
Heather Clemmons:
Awesome.
Susan Powers:
And I hope North Carolina never gets rid of them like they did teaching assistants from the lower grades because I do think they're beneficial regardless of how many different ways they're pulled. But I think they're very beneficial, especially for newer teachers like you've both heard. But I just hope they never get rid of them for whatever reasons.
Kyle Pillar:
Yeah, I was going to say I applied two years ago to be an academic coach just because I wanted to be able to give back and to work that angle. And it's still something I think about, but at the end of the day, I agree. I think that they are super important.
Laura:
Well, thank you.

Laura:
Thank y'all. So first question is just, and you guys, somebody can answer, we can piggyback off of each other, but how would you describe your experience with instructional coaching, or in this case working with your academic coach? And it doesn't have to be the person that you're working with now. It could be somebody that you worked with or experiences throughout your career. Some people have talked a lot about their experiences in the beginning of their career, but whatever experiences you have with instructional coaches.
Ashley Ayers:
Yeah, when you said experiences with instructional coaches, that definitely kind of brought up my first couple years starting at my school. My instructional coach was really instrumental in developing my beliefs as a teacher as far as my pedagogy and what I believed in as a teacher beyond just the curriculum that I was teaching.
Laura:
Okay. Anybody else?
Briana Coan:
I did a year subbing up in Pennsylvania where they didn't have academic coaches, so when I came down here it was definitely interesting to see. But they were also very helpful. They would help keep me sane in a way. I had a very tough class, so they helped me not only with my educational, but with my management and things like that. And so for the last seven years I've been here, we've had the ability to have those coaches help us out.
Laura:
Awesome.
Elsy Franklin:
Yeah, it does help a lot because this is my first year in Richmond County. I used to work at a different county, in Oslo County and it was a little different. I was in NC Pre-K, so it was me on my own. But now it's really nice to see that I can have that feedback, whatever I need, and to help me catching up because I'm the new one on the team. So it does help a lot to have her come in on, "Hey," reminding me there's this, this, this to go on. And today she's like, "Hey, don't forget to put this inside your data tracker."
So it's really nice to have her reminding me and emailing me and telling me what to do so I can be prepared for the PLCs. So it does help a lot. She also provides us a lot of materials, resources, things that she can help. She comes in sometimes to our class and she's like, "Oh yeah, this strategy once worked with my group." So that helps me a lot with resources and ideas because Pre-K is very different. The NC Pre-K is very different to kindergarten and she does help me a lot. Not just resources material, but feedback. So I do like that.
Ashley Ayers:
Yeah, it's nice to have kindergarten.
It's definitely nice to have a go-between our curriculum heads and somebody at the school that's not necessarily admin. It's sort of somebody that's designated as the person who's going to kind of hand out those, "Hey, curriculums, this, this, and this. We're looking to doing this." I know, same as Bree, I subbed in Pennsylvania my first year out of college. And the couple of times that I would see curriculum heads coming through the buildings, you could tell that they were not integrated in the buildings. They knew what was going on, but they didn't at the same time just because they had so many buildings to get to.
So with the academic coaches, it's nice because they know their building, they know their teachers. And I feel like at least the academic coaches that I've had the fortune of working with have known me, known what my expectations are and know what my kids' expectations are. So it's nice that they're on the same page that the rest of us are because they're in the building with us.
Emily Danner:
Yes. And as a part of working side-by-side with the admin team, they serve as a good liaison between the teachers and the county, and also the teachers and the administration. When everybody's being a team player, it's helpful because they kind of help filter things and help give insight to a teacher's perspective sometimes when school-wide decisions are being made.
Laura:
Okay, great. Talk to me about direct support. What kind of direct support do you receive from your academic coach?
Ashley Ayers:
Usually materials to start out with. Right now it's a lot of instructional materials as far as interventions. With the way that we switched over to two new curriculums, we're also then switching over to a lot of new interventions and just making sure that we're all on the same page where we need to be for our MTSS and using the right tools. So that's been kind of the big thing that we've used this year, the academic coaches, and then in previous years it's been modeling lessons. I had an academic coach that would run book clubs to do basically pedagogy and developing us as teachers along with our instruction and stuff like that.
Emily Danner:
Yeah, I agree. Ashley and Bree and I all have the same experiences with the same coaches, so have I'm sure the same answers. But this year it's been, the coaches have been inundated, I think with all the curriculum changes and being supportive in those roles and helping us find the materials that we need and where they are and how to get to them.
But also as Richmond County re-rolls out learning-focused thought, train of thought into our classrooms again, the coaches have kind of been given the, "Here present this." And so that's been a lot of her supportive role this year has revolved around new curriculum and then making sure that we are in compliance and understand the purpose of the learning-focused model.
Elsy Franklin:
And ours is really focused on that data driven and helps us understand our data, look at our data. We fill out core planning sheets with her and things like that.
Laura:
Okay. In what ways do you think instructional coaching has contributed to your growth and development as a teacher, or not at all?
Elsy Franklin:
It does help because I do feel I'm growing more. The last time I taught kindergarten was like seven years ago, so it's a lot, many years ago that I haven't been in kindergarten. So she does help a lot. The Benchmark Advance, it's a new curriculum, she helps us a lot catching up. She's like, "Yeah, this is new for me too, but let me find this out for you." So she always is like, "Hey." Whenever we have a PLC, she does a lot of research before she explains to us. So she explains where the assessments are, how to get intervention, the constant reminders, which I really love, and the feedback to tell me, "Hey, have you done this?" And I just love that little reminder. And I like that she's right next to my class, so that helps a lot.
So it's nice to see that she's always researching so she can give us the information we need. And she's always giving us handouts like, "This will work really well. This has worked before. This works really well." So she does give us plenty of information so we could keep growing. And if something doesn't work, she always asks us like, "Hey, how did it go?" So we're like, "Oh, it did well." Okay. She comes up with another idea and says, "Hey, this is another worksheet that you could work on. And there's plenty of books." So she does share a lot of information with us that helps us to get the children to learn in different ways. And she does provide a lot of strategies.
Briana Coan:
Ours was extremely helpful. When I first got here, I was put on a team of three brand new teachers and one teacher that had two years experience. So ours really stepped up and they made us understand how guided reading worked. They helped us understand lesson planning, things like that. They really made us into what we were doing. If we really didn't understand something, they would take time out of their day, come in our classroom, model a lesson or show us a lesson to make sure we were doing it and understanding it.
Also, being from Pennsylvania, when I came back down here, we had a math curriculum up in Pennsylvania, and when we first got here, there was no math curriculum. So they really started explaining the standards to us, what we're doing, how we're doing it, what we're focusing on, and things like that. And that really helped me because I was like, "Wait, you want me to just plan these lessons by myself on math? There's no little booklet to follow through or things like that?" So they really took us under our wing our first years and really checked in to make sure we understood what we were teaching.
Ashley Ayers:
Yeah. I'll piggyback off of Bree as far as we would've had the same academic coaches those years. But I always come back to the book clubs that our academic coach ran where we were able to sit as a cohort of, usually it was grade three, four, and five, and we would a short book, but it was all about why we taught what we taught or best practices essentially. So we were able to do that as a cohort of adults and really kind of dive into. Brand new teachers, teachers that have been teaching for five, 10 years, but then teachers who are on the other end of that spectrum and kind of hear those experiences as we're sitting there and kind of realize what best practice was. And that really developed me as a teacher in what I believe is what is important to teach and how to teach kids.
Laura:
Okay. Anybody else? We just have a couple more questions. How does it help you address challenges in your job?
Ashley Ayers:
Honestly, outside of my team, my academic coach is usually the first person I go to if I'm having a problem. Doing all these interventions and stuff like that, definitely she's the first person that I'm going to. I'm brand new to a grade level this year, so I go to my team first, usually be like, "Hey, how are we doing this? How are we doing that?" And then beyond that, it's going to my academic coach for really any kind of classroom problem I might have. Run it by her at least see what she's thinking, what solution she might have for me.
Briana Coan:
I'm new to second grade too, but when I was in first grade, and I know with the first-grader team where we were standards wise, and with this new program, there's a lot of inconsistencies with what the standards say and what the program is. So she's our go-to to say, "Okay, they want us to teach two digit addition, subtraction problems, but in first grade, that's not what their standard was." So that's where we come and talk about, "Okay, what are we fixing? How are we going to do this?" And then she's like the liaison between our math lead as well for the county.
Laura:
Anybody else? Do you think that having direct support from your instructional coach or your academic coach influenced you to remain in the profession?
Emily Danner:
I would definitely say that that sometimes is the only lifeline that TIC teachers have. I started teaching in Charlotte and had I not had the instructional math and reading coaches as just a sounding board or just reassurance. And I've been sitting here thinking about how coaches guide us and give us answers to things in our classroom, but also just the confidence to try new things or the reassurance. Because they can see the big picture from an administrative point of view where we're really focused in on our one group, and them empowering us and giving us the confidence to, "Hey, we got this."
And just listening when we needed to complain and needed to sound off about something, I think that has been pivotal. I know in my career over the last 15 years, the different coaches that I've had have really helped me to anchor myself into, especially the school that I'm at now, but kept me coming back for sure when I was dropped sink or swim in CMS in the middle of Charlotte my first few years of teaching. That made a big difference for me.
Elsy Franklin:
Yeah, I definitely agree because I'll be honest, without her, it would be really hard and I would be struggling with a lot of content. Again, compared to the NC Pre-K and kindergarten, it's been many years. So she does help a lot to keep me sane. And just like her, I was always looking for help and I'm like, "Hey, can you help me out with this?" And she shares enough resources with me. So when I'm stuck, she always offers herself. So that's really nice.
So she's not just a nice coach, but she's also a really nice person where I have that trust in her that I can go and I can share with her all my problems. And she does always help. There's always a nice thing for her to tell me, "Hey, you can do it." So she encourages me with nice words and also, "Hey, you're doing great with this." So she does have those really good words for me when I'm stuck in the class with very loud children. So yeah, she does keep me sane too.
Briana Coan:
Yeah, I would piggyback off of them too, and say, yeah, they absolutely played a part in me being [inaudible 00:15:21] where I was because that first year was rough and they were there making sure I knew what I was doing, how I was doing, and trying to help me with whatever they possibly could. So yes, I would say they would play an absolute part in that.
Laura:
All right. Does anybody have any other just final thoughts or anything that you want to share with me about instructional or academic coaches?
Ashley Ayers:
I mean, I think an instructional coach needs to be attuned to their building. They need to know what their teachers know. I think it's extremely beneficial when they know the students, when they've worked with groups of students in that building in the past. Now, the past two academic coaches that I've worked with have either been interventionalists or actual teachers in our building that have transitioned to academic coaches. And it's nice to have a sounding board with kids that I've had that they've seen over kindergarten to third grade, or even just going from third grade to fourth grade. They've seen certain trends or they can tell me, "Hey, this isn't the first time we've seen this, so let's dive deeper." I just think it's really important that an academic coach to do their job really, really well, and to provide even more support for that teacher, they need to know the building. They need to know the teachers, they need to know the kids.
Laura:
I think that's interesting actually because we have had some discussions with some of my other groups just about relationships. Anybody want to tell? I mean, I think your relationship with your instructional coach is very, very important as well.
Ashley Ayers:
Oh, yeah. A good relationship or a bad relationship can make or break whether you have a good year or get a good teaching out of what you're trying to do.
Emily Danner:
Absolutely. And there are different strokes for different folks, I guess. But there are schools that I know that I've said, "I don't want to go be micromanaged by a principal and a coach." Some coaches get on a thing. I know people who are micromanagers and there's that control, and having to have control is important to them. And luckily, I haven't had that totally in my experience. I've had very supportive coaches. But I know that there are other schools and other places that I would be hesitant to hop on board and work there because of that.
So somebody who's able to build relationships with their teachers and the students is going to go a lot farther and is going to be a lot more effective in a building than somebody that's just there for digging into data and punching numbers.
Briana Coan:
I agree with both of them. The relationship is really a big part of it, but also I think it kind of helps. Now I've only been K-2, but I know from different experiences that having a coach that has experience in both backgrounds helps the entire school. If they're just a K-2 teacher, if they're just a 3-5 teacher, it's a little bit harder for them to know what everything is, and they have to really push themselves out there. And if they're not willing to push themselves out there, they struggle a little bit more. So it's definitely really important that they have that K-5 experience, not necessarily just a K-2 or 3-5 experience.
Laura:
Do you feel the same way with math and reading? I was an elementary principal for quite a few years before I got moved to the high school, and I had two coaches in the school at the same time. And so we tried to have one that was more ELA minded and one more math minded. Do you feel like that?
Briana Coan:
Yes. When I first got here, that's what we had. We were lucky enough to have two here.
Ashley Ayers:
We had an academic coach and an interventionalist technically.
Briana Coan:
Technically. But it was very helpful because you had the ELA mind who's now in our district office doing ELA, and then you had the math mind of the interventionalist who was able to provide you with that support in math when the other one was supposed to provide you that support in reading. And that really rounded you out as an educator.
Emily Danner:
Yeah. When I started in Charlotte, our school had a math instructional coach and a reading instructional coach. And at the time, the curriculum we had was Investigation, which was just a very materials heavy program. And it had similar to some of the i-Ready stuff, but it was very much, there was a game for every single day of every single lesson that had to be printed and made and done. And that was in the middle of Common Core being rolled out, and then Common Core being tweaked, and then the program being tweaked to the Core.
So, especially with big changes with the state, the pendulum swings from one ideology to another, which it is doing now. It was helpful to have somebody that could more quickly become an expert on all the things of that subject. And so I do think that it's harder to be an expert at everything all at one time, and especially depending on what your limit of experience is. And so I do think that, depending on the size of your building and the students and staff that you serve, that having both is helpful and beneficial.
Ashley Ayers:
Yeah, we've started doing self-contained, so I do like that our academic coach currently taught first grade. She taught math and reading. So it's nice to see that combination come through in the supplies and things that she'll give us. So I don't think isolation is necessarily always the best as far as becoming an expert in just reading or just math. But it is nice to have those additional staff members if depending on the size, you have a K-2 or you have a 3-5, or you have it split math and reading, but your math and reading person still really work closely with one another.

Laura:
Okay, so first question is just basically how would you describe your experiences with instructional coaching? And anybody who wants to go first can start us off.
Sasha Green:
My experience with Instructional Coaches, it has been wonderful because I remember when I just came here, the coach was Elizabeth Spangler and she was really good in providing feedback and allowed me to reflect a lot on what went right in the lesson, what went wrong, and then it just triggered that little reflective thinking.
When she used to come, she'd have a yellow note I think, and she would post the EQ, what was my EQ and what she saw in the classroom, what the students were doing. And then she'd ask questions like, "How did you know that the students got it?" And then that provoked me to think, "How did I know that the students got it?" So my experience has been wonderful with coaches.
Amy Davis:
I can go next. I've had good experiences with them. They're great. During PLC times, they'll meet with you after school if you need some help with something. They're really good for first year teachers, second year teachers, or anybody new to the district that doesn't understand maybe MTSS or lesson planning or any kind of curriculum that we have that they may not have had at their other schools. So they're very helpful.
Chylene Taylor:
Second year...
Jami Sutherland:
Go ahead.
Chylene Taylor:
In kindergarten, they have been very great for me, even though I've been teaching a long time, but... room and gave me suggestions. They've sat there and watched me teach to give me more ideas. They've sent me to other classrooms so I could see what they're doing. So for me, they have been great.
Jami Sutherland:
Yeah, well, I mean everybody's kind of saying everything that I think too, but I think, yeah, just the new suggestions that they give I think are helpful. And just helping in planning and helping us organize our thoughts and ideas and know what we have to do and what's coming up. I mean, I would really be lost without instructional coaches. I think I've taught without them before, and I think with them it's much easier to keep everything organized and they're helpful in knowing the curriculum and ours are great. So we are blessed by that.

Dave Wells:
I’m in my second year and they have been great for me. I came to teaching from a non-traditional path and I didn’t go to school to teach so they’ve been instrumental in helping me learn the ropes. 
Laura:
Casey, do you feel like your experience at the middle school is any different?
Kacy Schattauer:
I think my first couple of years of teaching, they were extremely helpful. I have noticed a difference since coming back from COVID and them just being pulled in so many different directions. For veteran teachers, I don't feel like we get as much support maybe that next tier of coaching that we would like, but I mean, they're being pulled in so many different directions.
Tyler McGirt:
So that's kind of like what I was going to say. I think it's great to have someone to run to and answer a question, but does the coaching thing reach the full potential?, It's I guess designed to do? And I would say no on that.
Laura:
Okay. So I think everybody's had a chance to answer that one. So the next one is what kind of direct support, and some of you touched on this in your initial answer, but just talk about direct support that you received from your school's instructional coach. And if you can be specific. I know somebody mentioned PLC's, well, if you talk about your coach's role in PLC's and how they facilitate PLC's, that would be helpful.
Jami Sutherland:
Are you asking for like... So they explicitly help us with lesson planning, the format that we have to use...
Yeah. Okay. So they do that and then, I mean, the PLCs I would assume are probably directed from central office. I mean, they ask us what we want, but then I think sometimes we get what we didn't ask for because of what we have to be given. But I would say for me personally, and I think our grade level, it's more specifically just lesson plan format that we have to use. And I guess if that's what you want, I don't know.
Laura:
Now when you're in the PLC meetings and you're working with that lesson plan format, do you feel like they're providing you with suggestions and strategies and things that you can incorporate into those plans? Or is that more you guys?
Chylene Taylor:
That's more us. On our team because we talk as a group more and then they might fit something in here and there, but it's more of us talking and giving suggestions.
Laura:
But if you have a question, like, "I'm struggling with this and I don't know how to... I'm struggling with my kids, they're not getting this concept." Are they ones that you would go to outside of your team for suggestions?
Chylene Taylor:
I would say yes.

Dave Wells: 
I go to them for everything. They have helped me plan and pick instructional strategies. Even things you wouldn’t think about like helping me come up with ways to get to know my students and build relationships with them. They have not only facilitated classroom visits for me but they’ve gone with me to visit other classrooms to complete observations and get ideas. 
Amy Davis:
Yeah, and I would go more to them for MTSS. Just a couple students, they would help me pull more resources than for just one struggling in the class.
Amy Davis:
And then they also help just to make sure that we're on the right pacing, make sure we're keeping up with the district.
Sasha Green:
At the high school, my coach, she facilitates the meetings, she'll ask questions. We do a lot of data analysis during those PLCs, so she'll facilitate by ensuring that we're on track with pacing, if we have someone new, we share resources with them, stuff like that. But when it comes to the data analysis, she'll open the door for questions and she'll ask if a teacher is doing well in a particular area, she'll ask that teacher to suggest what are you doing while your students are mastering that standards versus someone else, what they're doing and stuff like that. So at the high school, facilitating and then we have walk throughs too where we get feedback using the ELA tool and we'll get the feedback from the coach. So those are some direct ways that she assists.
Laura:
Ms. Green, when you get that feedback from walk throughs, does that typically include maybe coaching suggestions or things that, "Hey, did you think about trying this?" Or what does that look like?
Sasha Green:
Previously I've had that experience where I'd be doing a particular topic and especially if it's a math person, because then when it's not... It looks a little different too, based on which coach, because we have two. So if it's a math-based coach, then they'll have more direct suggestion for me but if it's just a general coach, then the suggestions might not be so applicable to my course. But when it's math-based, yes, they might suggest, "Oh, have you thought about grouping them this way?" Or just general strategies.
Laura:
Okay. Anybody else have direct supports that you receive from your coach?
Amy Davis:
I don't. And I guess a lot of it comes from just being a veteran teacher. They gear more into the beginning teachers.
Laura:
Anybody had any of your coaches model lessons with you or come in and co-teach with you to help you become more comfortable with the topic or standard?

Dave Wells:
I have. They have modeled for me and co-taught lessons with me. 
Tyler McGirt:
I haven't, but I think if you ask, they would do it.
Jami Sutherland:
Yeah, that's what I was going to say. I mean, they have offered or I have heard them offer for other teachers if it's necessary, but they've...
Laura:
Okay. In what ways do you think instructional coaching has contributed to your professional growth and development? And this can be long-term for as long as you've worked with a coach. How do you think it's impacted your professional growth and development?
Jami Sutherland:
I think they're helpful. So I think I would wish we had one if we didn't. I am like Amy, it just as things change, I think we need them. I mean, I've been teaching a long time, but formats change or curriculums change, and so I feel like they're useful for that to introduce the new things as they come. I mean, I would say I definitely like having them there.
Amy Davis:
I agree. I like having them and sometimes they don't have kids all day, so they're able to do some research to find some different materials that we may need or find interesting that may be helpful. So where they have the little extra time that we don't have and then sharing it with us and they're easy to talk to, so that kind of helps. They help you get on... They kind of just talk to you like a person. So it's not like you have to... If you had to talk to a peer, you would kind of feel like you weren't doing your job right, but they make you feel okay and try to give you resources to help.
Laura:
So I think most of you in here have probably worked with multiple instructional coaches at this point. So would you say that the relationship that you have with your instructional coach impacts the level of effectiveness of a coach?
Tyler McGirt:
Most definitely.
Amy Davis:
Yes. Yes.
Jami Sutherland:
Absolutely.
Chylene Taylor:
Yes.
Laura:
Why do y'all think that is?
Jami Sutherland:
Well, I think they're just an ear. I mean, I can remember years just sitting in... Every year there's always a tear or two shed because you are just stressed or whatever. So sometimes they're just a venting session for you because they understand the pressure that we have. And like Amy said... I've never had a bad one. I've been through a few and I do try to form a relationship with them so that they're easy to talk to and helpful. And so yeah, they definitely help in those situations.
Sasha Green:
It's like when you get new students, you get to know them and the more you get to know them, the more comfortable you feel working with them. So it's the same thing with a coach over the years, you're familiar with this coach, they'll know your strengths and basically you can just say, "Oh, I'd like assistance with this." And they'll go, "Okay." They'll seek stuff. They'll know what's the things that would interest you, put it that way. So they might come to you and be like, "Oh, I realize you like to use scavenger hunt. I found this." They might provide a resource that's more tailored to you because you get to know them so well.
So the relationship that you have because if I'm not comfortable with someone, I'm not going to ask a question or... So the relationship, I think, and I think that goes for most teachers. If you're comfortable, you won't feel dumb asking a question. Once you get to know someone, you'll feel at ease working with them.
Tyler McGirt:
I also think it's important to have a relationship, I guess, because most of the time when a coach comes in, they're telling you what you need to improve. And most of the time a teacher already knows that and then they're reminding you and if a stranger tells you what you need to fix versus, I won't say a friend, but someone you, I guess trust or have respect for, that makes a big difference.
Laura:
Anybody else? Okay. How has instructional coaching in some of these, you've touched on some of this, but just more specifically, how has instructional coaching or your instructional coaches helped you to address challenges that you face as a teacher?
Tyler McGirt:
I guess I go back to small groups.
Chylene Taylor:
I was going to say that.
Tyler McGirt:
I won't say I like to, but if there's a relationship there or a bond between the teacher and the coach, you're more willing to try it to almost please them, if that makes sense. Because I guess they're asking you to do it, that means they kind of believe in you and that kind of stuff. I don't know.
Kacy Schattauer:
I think ours has done a great job and we've had issues within our team of teachers. Middle school is hard when you've got four different adults with their own independent ideas all coming together, sometimes those ideas clash. And I think ours does a great job of pulling everybody in, looking at it from the outside and just helping us work as a team. I think that's a big role of ours at the middle school level.
Laura:
Okay. Anybody else? I guess when I think about coaches at different levels, do they assist or not maybe assist but provide you feedback on things other than your actual instruction, like classroom management routines, procedures, processes, things like that that could help maybe make your classroom run more smoothly?

Dave Wells:
Yes, they were very helpful with management strategies, routines, and procedures, especially when I was in my first year. It was very beneficial. 
Amy Davis:
When they do walkthroughs, they'll either say, "You may need to do more routines to get them to..." Okay. So just more for routine. They keep repeating routine, routine, routine and seeing it they can tell whether you've taught a bunch of routines or the kids understand it. And then they can also tell when you haven't. Just giving that feedback to help us of things that they would do to change.
Jami Sutherland:
Yeah, and I think we meet with them for lesson plans, but then we also meet for MTSS and then we meet for behavior. So I mean they're always given suggestions for each of the topics, whatever we're in there for, if it's academics or behavior. So yeah, I think that they provide ideas in all the situations.
Laura:
How do you see them as a form of providing you guys with professional development?
Jami Sutherland:
This past couple of years we've been starting the new phonics programs and stuff. And I mean, they'll do little PDs on that and it's helpful. Like I said, you teach them a long time, but things change. And so when we get a new curriculum or a new whatever, I just [inaudible 00:18:37] coming to mind, we had no idea how to do that. And so they would sit down with us and then like Amy said, they have more time on their hands, so they're like, watch the videos. Well, there's thousands of videos, you don't know what to watch.
So they'll pull them and just have those during our PDs, the ones that are the best. So that kind of stuff has really helped me the last couple of years because I mean, we've got all new curriculums and all new phonics and I mean it's just a lot, lesson plan formats and so they just, I think just organize it a little bit for us so that when we come in, it's like one thing at a time. Usually weekly, one new thing they throw at us, so it's not all at once and then it's already done for us. So we just have to fill in the blanks, kind of.

Laura:
Kacy and Ms. Green. Do you guys see it differently at the secondary level? I mean, do you see instructional coaching as a form of professional development?
Sasha Green:
Some. It depends, because when I initially started, I'm looking right now in my desk for some yellow papers that Ms. Spangler used to walk around with. And she would come in the room and she would stay 25, 30 minutes and she would write, time, five minute interval and then she would go through what she saw me doing. Then she would set up question for reflection.
And one of the questions, I'm looking at the paper that she gave some years ago, which at that time I was new to the district, new to the country, new to the whole teaching in this environment. And she had a feedback, "How do you determine partners?" Because the students were working in pairs, so she was like, "How do you determine partners?" Another one, her question was, "What went well in the lesson? What would you change in the lesson?"
She looked at where my anchor charts were posted and she had a term called prime real estate. And coming from another country, a letter that helped me to develop based on how it was done. So then I started to question things or understand more. Currently, they do support us at the high school level, Mrs Trudy is very big on that. She'll help you provide support, PD wise.
Even, Ms. [inaudible 00:21:10], last week she was asking what do we need help on? What would be something worthwhile for her to do a PD on? So yes, they do support us that way. And for the people who are not tech-savvy at the high school level, Mrs Trudy definitely going to make you a little video on how to sync your canvas, how to do... So that's very useful because a lot of people won't openly ask for that help because they don't want to look like, I don't know, but she'll just think ahead and prepare stuff like that for staff.
Kacy Schattauer:
I agree. I think the similar feel at the middle school level. We got new curriculum. I know math has a curriculum, ELA has a different curriculum. They're working on a science one. So I think ours does a great job in making sure that everybody is comfortable with just basically how to use it. But then some of us spend more time digging in a little bit deeper. So if I go to her and I say, "Hey, this is something that I found," or "Hey, I'm having trouble with this." I think she has a great job of giving that individual time to, depending on your comfort level of the curriculum... No, get out of court. Okay. That's nice.
Laura:
But I guess do you feel like the role of the instructional coach is a lot to do with I guess the expectations of the leadership and the school?
Jami Sutherland:
Yes.
Laura:
Okay. I don't know what you guys heard, but I was kind of asking if you feel like what your instructional coaches do and their role is more driven by... What drives them? Is it the expectations of the principal, the district? Do you think it's more based on individual teacher needs? What are your thoughts?
Tyler McGirt:
I think it's technically designed to be individualized based on teacher needs, but it is not used that way.
Sasha Green:
I agree. It's more driven by what's expected from a central office level.
Tyler McGirt:
Because when you say PD, I think about professional development to meet my needs in the classroom. I mean, they are great at teaching us things and all that good stuff, but I guess when you think about professional development to make me a better teacher, I wouldn't necessarily say, I don't want to say that they don't, because they do to a certain extent, but I guess not as effective or as a way it should be done. Does that make sense?
Laura:
Maybe not as differentiated, but we're looking at the core. If we're going to use MTSS terms, we're looking at the core and we're focusing on what we feel like all teachers need, but maybe we're not getting down to those... And is that, I mean, is that basically what you feel?
Tyler McGirt:
Yes.
Chylene Taylor:
Yep.
Sasha Green:
I agree.
Amy Davis:
I agree too. It is mostly what they're told to teach us or do a PD on and then that's what they have to do. It may not be something we need, but they're told to do it.
Laura:
Okay.
Jami Sutherland:
Yeah. I agree too. But I think in their defense it's what they're told to do. I think we have to remember that. I think they want to do what we need. I hope they want to do what we need, but it's like with the whole system and your hands are tied sometimes.
Sasha Green:
But Ms. Sutherland sometimes too when we have those PDs and they'll say, what else do you need additional training on? I'm wondering how many people actually really be honest and fill that section in now and then, because if the feedback is not, well, I guess they'll just say, "Oh, you can't decide. Let's decide then."
Jami Sutherland:
Yeah, no, I agree with that.
Laura:
Okay. I just have a couple more questions.
Laura:
And this one is kind of multi there's, there's multiple questions here, but the first is talk to me about what factors... Because I think most of you in here are pretty veteran teachers and you've talked about that, but what factors have led to your decision to remain a teacher? And then I want you to think about did having this support, and that doesn't have to be like right now, but maybe earlier in your career, did having the support from an instructional coach impact your decision to stay in the profession? Or maybe you didn't even think about leaving, but you can reflect and say that having that instructional coach helped me... I know when I started teaching we didn't have instructional coaches, 24 years ago. I had a mentor and that was about it. So do you feel like that strong instructional coaching initiatives can help retain teachers and did that impact you in any way?
Jami Sutherland:
I definitely think so. I mean, I didn't have them either. I mean, I had a mentor and she was great actually, but she taught in the classroom too. So I think having one outside the classroom, yeah. I don't really remember, for 20 years, I think there's been an instructional coach, at least one, now with two. I mean, it kind of makes it even more possible to get all of your answers quicker when you'd have more than one. But yeah, I would definitely say, especially for new teachers who are coming in fresh, I mean, it's just a person outside of the classroom you can go to anytime. So yeah, I would definitely say it would be a factor in keeping teachers.
Tyler McGirt:
Well, I guess I won't say that they have kept me in the classroom, if that makes sense. I guess my first... I didn't have an instructional coach until I came here my first five years it was me figuring out how to swim on my own. And I guess the reason I haven't left because I think about what I spent going to college to be a teacher and then the idea of starting over. I do think about that. I will say, now that I think about it, I think having an instructional coach is keeping everyone in the school on the same page. I look at what, I guess my previous experience, it was pretty much everybody did whatever they thought to do versus everybody's doing the same thing or walking in the same direction, if that makes sense.
Laura:
Definitely.
Sasha Green:
An instructional coach can impact how you feel as a teacher about studying the professional. Because when I mentioned working with Miss Spangler, I've worked with Miss Ritudi and I remember there was one coach, her name was Ashley, I don't remember her last name, but her first name was Ashley and Lord, when they gave us the learning focus, lesson plan, everyone was like, and she was so helpful, she would sit with us, we'd make Buffalo chicken dip and we'd stay back and write those lesson plans until we had a whole folder for every single unit in math two. And she would go around and she would do it for other areas because she was in math at the time, and that was very helpful because just thinking about losing the whole weekend, writing the lesson plans, that kind of alleviated some stress.
She did help at that point because a lot of teachers were like, "Oh, we don't want to do this." But her sitting there too and actually working, we'll just make the EQs together, we'll discuss everything. It made it a lot easier and it really made you not think like, "Oh Lord, I should give up."
Laura:
Anybody else? Factors that led to your decision to remain as a teacher?

Dave Wells: 
I really like kids. I’m older and don’t have a lot of time in the profession, so having their support maybe didn’t make me stay, but it helped me not leave if that makes sense. 
Amy Davis:
Well, I'm kind of like Tyler. Just once you get so far in deep, you just can't leave. But I guess I've just been for the past 20 years, been blessed with good facilitators. So I guess that also helps in retaining teachers. If you get stuck with ones that are not as nice or forthcoming with you, it could make you leave the profession.
Laura:
What do you guys think are the qualities that you need to have in a good instructional coach?
Amy Davis:
Well, I think they need to know the curriculum for one. For me, for elementary, they need to know the curriculum K5. And it's also, they need to come to you as a helper, not, "Oh, you should change this immediately." I guess just being kind and understanding and not to forget that they were once in a classroom too. I think that helps too.
Jami Sutherland:
Yeah. And just like we've been talking about the relationship that you have with them, because I mean, you have to feel like they like you and that they want you to do well, that they're on your side.
Tyler McGirt:
I guess I think about someone... I think when they come into classroom rather than just observe, I think you can also provide feedback by jumping in and helping. And I think taking that approach would make a big difference. But just being able to, I guess, to realize that the teacher's human and that little 45 minute blurb does not show everything. I think looking at the big picture and also knowing, "All right, this teacher's not having a good day or knowing the teacher, so let's not tell them what they need to fix, but maybe let's look at what was awesome today and leave it at that."
So to me, it's not necessarily every time they go in, they should tell what needs to happen, but rather let me see what's good or tell that teacher what's good. Because sometimes, what I do all the time, I may not... I guess I'm so used to it, I don't realize it's good anymore. So I guess showing or reminding that teacher, "What you're doing up there is great. The way you get the kids to understand something." I guess that would be good to take that approach, if that makes sense.
Laura:
Anybody else?
Sasha Green:
Trustworthy. Trustworthy because if the teachers can't trust the coach, nothing's going to happen. There must exist. That trust in the relationship where if the teacher need to break down to say, "Well, I bummed it, I don't know what to do." They should feel comfortable enough to say it to the coach, knowing that the coach will help them through. Not that they can solve everything, but help them through in a manner where they don't feel less than, or as Tyler said, like it's an attack. Because that's a big thing too. A lot of teachers probably want to bar and close the doors when they see a coach walking back because thinking, "Oh, I'm up for an attack now." So having that little trust kind of make it feel like, and if the person comes in and as he said, to get on the ground with you, you'll feel like, "Okay, yeah, you want me to win and we going to do this." And you'll be more open to take whatever suggestion is given, good or bad.
Tyler McGirt:
I also think it is important to realize that the coach is advocating for the teacher. I think that is a big game changer. When you know that this person is kind of the middle man for what the district is telling that needs to happen in the school. And I guess the coach is telling you, "All right, that's not feasible because this is what these teachers are having to do." I think that's a big, I guess, important thing to know that they're advocating for what happens in the classroom.
Laura:
Awesome. Anybody else?
Okay, last question. And it's just very general, but is there anything else that you'd like to share with me about your experience as a recipient of instructional coaching? So I'm like, looking at perceptions of the teachers have of instructional coaches and instructional coaching initiatives, but also can I make any direct correlation to teacher retention? I mean, is instructional coaching an effective form of professional development and support for teachers so much so that it could keep a teacher in the classroom rather than leaving the profession? And some of you have talked a little bit about ways that you could see strengthening instructional coaching in the district but if you have anything else like that that you'd like to share, I'd love to hear it and then I'll get you out of here.
I think one thing that I heard from Casey was just the way the coaches roles have changed, and I think the way she termed it was being pulled in a million different directions. I could see that definitely at the secondary level, maybe a little bit more than the elementary level, but anything else about your experiences with instructional coaching that you'd like to share now?
Kacy Schattauer:
I will say being a math person, we have had, I guess, ELA minded or ELA focused facilitators in the past. I've had, I think maybe one or two years of teaching where I've had a math minded facilitator and I noticed a big difference in my PLC and how active I was because a lot of times we get up there and we hear people say, "Well, I'm not a math teacher." And that automatically, I'm like, "Well, then I don't know what you have to share with me that's going to help me be better or what I can learn from you." So I think that having a facilitator or multiple facilitators that have different areas of discipline.
Sasha Green:
I had that one. I wrote a few little things down before coming, and I had that on my list as specialist expert needed per content field so that the instruction and the support is more tailored to the department that they're over and more relatable to because if you know this person understands exactly what they're telling you to do or expecting you to do, the conversation is more fluent when you're having it with a person who's an expert in the field.
Kacy Schattauer:
Absolutely.
Sasha Green:
I also had that they could be more helpful when it comes to the mentorship creation because a lot of new teachers are complaining that they don't have mentors or support, but if a coach really walks around and understand the teachers, they could know who best to pair with who. And that would be big on keeping new teachers too, because then they'll realize if classroom management is this teacher's weakness, but this one is very good, they could suggest that to the principal, "You could pair this teacher with that teacher." To help them to strengthen the new teachers.
Because a lot of new teachers complain about not having support, but sometimes it's not only content support, it's probably classroom management, time management too and stuff like that. So I had that on my list. And then also I had one more staffing issues, forcing coaches to function less in their capacities, meaning if you're a test coordinator and coach, you might be testing for the whole week and not coaching that particular week, and that can impact effectiveness.
Laura:
Okay, thank you. Go ahead.
Amy Davis:
I think we're lucky to have two. We have one that is math-minded and ELA-minded, so they can join in during plan, but it also goes back to central office. What does central office have them doing where they can't be in the classrooms and getting around to help? And also, they're the first to be pulled if somebody is out for an extended period of time, like to do M classing or HMH benchmark. So they're great to be there, but then they're also the first to be pulled for something else.
